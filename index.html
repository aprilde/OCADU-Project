    <h2>VISION</h2>
    
    <p>Printfood's mission is to reduce food waste which will ultimatly reduce hunger and improve the state of the environment. Large shopping trips to the grocery store are casuing shoppers to buy large quanities of good all at once. Many times they buy more then their household will use before expiration. By replacing shopping trips with on-demand food printing, a household will have a higher success rate of only aquiring what they need.</p>
